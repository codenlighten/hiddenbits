        <h2>Introduction to Our Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          At HiddenBits, we specialize in the art of steganography, enabling
          users to embed secret messages within images in a way that is
          invisible to the naked eye. Here's an in-depth look at our method:

      <section>
        <h2>Steganography and the LSB Technique</h2>
        <p>
          Our process starts with steganography, the technique of hiding
          information within digital media. In particular, we use the Least
          Significant Bit (LSB) method, which involves altering the least
          important bits in an image's pixel data to embed secret messages. This
          method is favored for its simplicity and the high level of secrecy it
          provides.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Encryption for Added Security</h2>
        <p>
          Security is paramount, so before embedding any text into an image, we
          first encrypt the message using advanced encryption standards. This
          ensures that even if the presence of the message is discovered,
          deciphering it without the correct key remains impossible.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Embedding and Retrieval Process</h2>
        <p>
          To embed a message, users simply upload an image, enter their message,
          and, if desired, specify a password for encryption. Our tool then
          processes the image, embedding the encrypted message using the LSB
          technique. Retrieving the message involves a similar process in
          reverse, requiring the correct password to decrypt and reveal the
          hidden text.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Blockchain Integration</h2>
        <p>
          For users seeking permanence, we offer the option to publish the image
          with the embedded message to the blockchain. This method ensures that
          the message becomes immutable and permanently accessible, leveraging
          the security and reliability of blockchain technology.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Key Management</h2>
        <p>
          Our platform also supports comprehensive key management
          functionalities, allowing users to generate, import, and manage
          cryptographic keys. This feature enhances the overall security of the
          steganographic process, ensuring users have full control over their
          data.
